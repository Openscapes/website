*From spring 2022-2023 I have had the pleasure of being a Better Scientific Software (BSSw) Fellow, by the Exascale Computing Project (17-SC-20-SC), a collaborative effort of the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) Office of Science and the National Nuclear Security Administration; and by the National Science Foundation (NSF) under Grant No. 2154495. This is an excerpt from my final progress report to the The Krell Institute, who adminstered this award.*
