*This post is by Xiaohua Pan, from NASA GSFC/Goddard Earth Sciences Data and Information Services Center (GES DISC). Pan participated in the 2021 Cloud Hackathon, led by NASA Data Center (DAAC) staff who are part of the NASA Openscapes Mentor community. Following this first hands-on introduction to NASA Earthdata in the cloud, Pan continued to experiment with transitioning her workflow to the cloud. Sharing her experience through posters, talks, and here in this blog post, she is a research scientist, a data curator, and a bridge-builder between data centers and the user community.*

## Introducing Pathway of Cloud Computing to the NASA user community

On May 4, 2023, Xiaohua Pan, Christopher Battisto, and Nicholas Lenssen (GES DISC) gave a presentation titled "**Pathway Finder of Cloud Computing using NASA Resources: A Case Study of Characterizing Wildfires in Western U.S.,"** hosted by the NASA GSFC Ocean Ecology Lab.

This presentation aims to inform and educate the NASA user community on cloud data and cloud computing. They shared the pathways, benefits, and roadblocks to cloud computing using an interdisciplinary case study and live demos of various cloud-accessing scenarios done in a JupyterHub that is part of the [NASA Openscapes](https://nasa-openscapes.github.io) project managed by [2i2c](http://2i2c.org/).

Xiaohua also shared her journal from a scientist doing her research with all on-premises data to a pathfinder conducting her wildfire research in the cloud to shed some light on others to find their journeys to the cloud. Finally, she emphasized the importance of cloud training gained through openscapes as a DAAC staff. This presentation reached about 70 people from NASA earth science divisions and universities. It was well received, with many questions and positive feedback, reflecting the interest and puzzlement of the NASA user community on cloud data and cloud computing.
