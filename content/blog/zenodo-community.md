*We created a [Zenodo Openscapes Community](https://zenodo.org/communities/openscapes)!*

------------------------------------------------------------------------

We want to share our work in a way that other people can find it, use it, improve it, and cite it. [Zenodo](https://zenodo.org/) is a general-purpose open repository that allows researchers to deposit research related digital artefacts like research papers, data sets, research software, reports, lesson materials, and presentations. For each submission, a persistent [digital object identifier](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_object_identifier "Digital object identifier") (DOI) is minted, which makes the stored items easily citable (adapted from [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zenodo)). Zenodo allows for versioning and we can preserve GitHub repositories in Zenodo too (GitHub itself is *not* a repository!).

To take it a step further, we created a [Zenodo Openscapes Community](https://zenodo.org/communities/openscapes/) as a "semantically meaningful group" of selected products to make our work more visible and findable. NASA's Transform to Open Science ([TOPS](https://zenodo.org/communities/tops/)) and the Center for Scientific Collaboration and Community Engagement's ([CSCCE](https://zenodo.org/communities/cscce/)) Zenodo Communities were inspirations for ours.

## Our use cases

We want to make these things citable: Lesson series, Cookbook, key presentations (feel good about reusing a slide by citing the presentation!), and key blog posts. We don't want to include everything; too big and the community site's value diminishes.

**Get a DOI for materials on GitHub** e.g. Openscapes Champions Lesson Series ([source](https://github.com/openscapes/series); [website](https://openscapes.github.io/series/); [Zenodo](https://zenodo.org/record/7407247)) and the NASA Earthdata Cloud Cookbook ([source](https://github.com/nasa-openscapes/earthdata-cloud-cookbook); [website](https://nasa-openscapes.github.io/earthdata-cloud-cookbook/); [Zenodo](https://zenodo.org/record/778671)). We follow [Metadocencia\'s How-to Guidance](https://www.metadocencia.org/en/post/compartirmaterialdoi/). It\'s clear, has great annotated screenshots, and is also available in Spanish. Our [Approach Guide](https://openscapes.github.io/approach-guide/approach/documentation.html#make-our-documentation-citable) outlines some specifics for us.

**Upload a new record to Zenodo to, get a DOI and have the record associated w the Zenodo Openscapes Community** Approach Guide [link](https://openscapes.github.io/approach-guide/approach/tooling.html#how-to-publish-a-new-record-in-zenodo-to-get-a-doi)

## Play in the Sandbox

Want to create a Zenodo Community? Use the [Sandbox](https://sandbox.zenodo.org/) in which anyone can create and refine a draft Community before making the real thing. Creating a Sandbox version forces you to recognize decisions to make before creating the real thing, like: needing to create it from an account that looks professional like \"curator\", rather than a personal email username; or deciding what types of research products to include. This webinar section \"[How to create a community](https://youtu.be/yj2r8RayIX8?t=734)\" screenshares a walk-through that makes things crystal clear.
