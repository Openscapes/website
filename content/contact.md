## WELCOME!
Openscapes is about engaging, empowering, and amplifying each other as we increase the visibility, value, and practice of open data science within our scientific communities. We are happy you are here. 


<!---
We welcome you to engage however best works for you! We are @openscapes on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/openscapes), [Medium](https://medium.com/@openscapes), and [Github](https://github.com/openscapes).**

We are excited to grow the Openscapes community and open data science communities more broadly. Here are several avenues to get involved, and please [email us](mailto:openscapes@nceas.ucsb.edu) with more ideas. 

### Follow us on Twitter @openscapes

We are [@openscapes](https://twitter.com/openscapes) on Twitter. We tweet about Openscapes news and events, amplify Openscapes Champions, and sporadically retweet other awesome things going on around environmental open data science. Tag us in your tweets about your open data science wins and challenges and we'll retweet!

### Join our mailing list

Sign up for our [mailing list](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdgVXRp3V-w94GPWkR31RUfyBl37EphdQSlCOcnyeNlf8OLWw/viewform?usp=sf_link) to receive infrequent emails from Openscapes so you can be aware of opportunities to participate in and amplify Openscapes efforts as they unfold.

Additionally, as we grow, we will welcome members of the open community to be involved as mentors, à la [Mozilla Open Leaders](https://foundation.mozilla.org/en/opportunity/mozilla-open-leaders/). If you are interested, please indicate your interest on the mailing list sign up. 

### Talk with your colleagues

Share your enthusiasm with others! Open data science is so powerful and empowering, we think the best way to engage others is to talk about it more. You can do this informally and in data-centric meetings ("Seaside Chats"). We hope our column [Supercharge your research: a ten-week plan for open data science](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-019-03335-4) can help start and continue these conversations. And please share your experiences — [tag us](https://twitter.com/openscapes) on Twitter, or add additional weekly activities in the column's [github repository](https://github.com/Openscapes/supercharge-research). 

### Amplify through media and events

In your next presentations and publications, include a slide or sentence about open data science — what you have done and/or why it's important. You're welcome to use/remix slides from our [presentations](/media).

As you plan department seminar series, conferences, or webinar series, consider inviting Openscapes or others from the open data science community as a speaker!

### Book a Champions Cohort or Workshop

It is now possible to book complete Openscapes Champions Cohorts and Workshops. Cohorts are led remotely over 5 months, and Workshops are led in-person for 2 full days, and both involve 7-10 participating research groups. Please [download this 2-pager](https://github.com/Openscapes/website/raw/master/static/OpenscapesCohorts_2pager.pdf) for more information and [email us](mailto:openscapes@nceas.ucsb.edu) to discuss booking. 

### Sponsor Champions Cohorts and Workshops

We are thankful for the funding support that makes Openscapes possible, and are interested in further partnerships. If you are interested in sponsoring research groups to participate in the Openscapes Champions program, please [email us](mailto:openscapes@nceas.ucsb.edu).

### Email us with your ideas

There are more awesome ways to get involved with Openscapes and open data science than we have written above — please [email us](mailto:openscapes@nceas.ucsb.edu) with your ideas for getting involved!
