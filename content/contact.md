## WELCOME!
Openscapes is about engaging, empowering, and amplifying each other as we increase the visibility, value, and practice of open data science within our scientific communities. We are happy you are here. 

## Our current projects

- [**Openscapes Champions Cohorts**](https://openscapes.org/champions) — We aim to lead Champions Cohorts each year while also developing Mentors who can lead Cohorts for their own communities as part of their jobs
- [**NASA Openscapes Framework**](https://nasa-openscapes.github.io) — We support researchers using NASA Earthdata served from the Distributed Active Archive Centers (DAACs) as they migrate workflows to the cloud
- [**NOAA Fisheries Openscapes**](https://nmfs-openscapes.github.io) — We have supported 10 Champions Cohorts with NOAA Fisheries (National Marine Fisheries Service NMFS) and a growing Mentor community
- [**California Water Boards Openscapes**](https://cawaterboarddatacenter.github.io/swrcb-openscapes/) — The California Water Boards / CalEPA forked the Champions program and have led it internally and are part of our Mentor Community
- [**Pathways to Open Science**](https://openscapes.github.io/pathways-to-open-science/) — We support Black environmental & marine researchers building community for the future of data intensive science. This program is led by Ileana Fenwick of Openscapes in partnership with [Black in Marine Science (BIMS)](https://www.blackinmarinescience.org/) and [Black Women in Ecology, Evolution, and Marine Science (BWEEMS)](https://www.bweems.org/).

We are excited to grow the Openscapes community and open data science communities more broadly. Here are several avenues to get involved, and please [email us](mailto:hello@openscapes.org) with more ideas. 

### Follow us on Twitter @openscapes

We are [@openscapes](https://twitter.com/openscapes) on Twitter. We tweet about Openscapes news and events, amplify Openscapes Champions, and sporadically retweet other awesome things going on around environmental open data science. Tag us in your tweets about your open data science wins and challenges and we'll retweet!

### Join our mailing list

Sign up for our [mailing list](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdgVXRp3V-w94GPWkR31RUfyBl37EphdQSlCOcnyeNlf8OLWw/viewform?usp=sf_link) to receive infrequent emails from Openscapes so you can be aware of opportunities to participate in and amplify Openscapes efforts as they unfold.

### Join an upcoming event

Please see our [events page](https://openscapes.github.io/events) for **Openscapes Community Calls**, **conference talks and seminars/webinars**, and opportunities through the **Champions Program**. 

### Book a Champions Cohort

Cohorts are led remotely over 2.5 months and involve ~7 participating research groups. Please [email us](mailto:hello@openscapes.org) if you're interested in booking a cohort.

### Sponsor Champions Cohorts and Workshops

We are thankful for the funding support that makes Openscapes possible, and are interested in further partnerships. If you are interested in sponsoring research groups to participate in the Openscapes Champions program, please [email us](mailto:hello@openscapes.org).

### Talk with your colleagues

Share your enthusiasm with others! Open data science is so powerful and empowering, we think the best way to engage others is to talk about it more. You can do this informally and in data-centric meetings ("Seaside Chats"). We hope our column [Supercharge your research: a ten-week plan for open data science](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-019-03335-4) can help start and continue these conversations. And please share your experiences — [tag us](https://twitter.com/openscapes) on Twitter, or add additional weekly activities in the column's [github repository](https://github.com/Openscapes/supercharge-research). 

### Amplify through media and events

In your next presentations and publications, include a slide or sentence about open data science — what you have done and/or why it's important. You're welcome to use/remix slides from our [presentations](/media).

As you plan department seminar series, conferences, or webinar series, consider inviting Openscapes or others from the open data science community as a speaker!

### Build and join local communities
Allison's tidy tuesday post
Additionally, there are many ways you can [help build and strengthen communities at your institution](/blog/2018/11/06/build-communities/).  


Our roots are in better science in less time. Here are some of the ways that is put into practice:
